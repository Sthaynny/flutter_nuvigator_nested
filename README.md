# :rocket: Technologies
This project was made using the follow technologies:


- `rootBundle`: reading data from a json file
- `componentization`: the project's custom components are in the folder "components or widgets"
- `color centering`: all as cores used in the app limit a file called app_colors which increases the customization power without much impact on the code logic.
- `image centering`: all the images used in the app come from a file called app_images which increases the customization power without much impact on the code logic.
- `nuvigator`: use of the library called [nuvigator](https://github.com/nubank/nuvigator) which allows us to manipulate the flow of routes, parameters, nested navigation and the like.
